 campuswide covid-19 outbreak declared as colorado state university records 375 cases  this is your quadrennial reminder that what everyone you know from indiana is saying is true: mike pence is a sociopath who made people pay for funeral rites for miscarriages, tried to legalize bigotry, and single-handedly caused a hiv outbreak by ignoring public health officials", "summary": "Pence's mishandling of HIV outbreak in Indiana sparks concerns about his role in Covid-19 task force The majority believe Pence's record on public health makes him unsuitable to lead the Covid-19 task force."}

stop lying to us. it isn\u2019t helping your non existent win. @theauraguardian it's called next level social distancing @sosus328 @robertl51378795 @fionaprine @joebiden wouldn\u2019t have told america that #covid__19 was basically the flu only to tell a journalist on the record in private that its 5x worse. his words caused people to take a highly contagious virus too lightly. this meant less social distancing, no masks, \u2b06\ufe0f death. this undecided voter on cnn just said he wants to reopen all businesses because we know how to practice social distancing and wear masks.   he runs a salon.  that undecided male voter apparently doesn\u2019t realize that we,  the richest country in the world still has no leadership to fight the virus with support for ppes, masks, social distancing and rapid testing.  leader's lead.   watching the cnn focus group of undecided voters. to the man who thought it\u2019s unfair to put the 200k deaths from covid on trump... it is on him. he downplayed this virus. he doesn\u2019t encourage masks. he doesn\u2019t encourage social distancing. its all on him. @curranwrites @joebiden but he tried, trump would not let him speak. bidens plan is what science recommended in the first place. fast testing, to isolate the ill and let the well go about their business, masks and social distancing. @potus had a chance to encourage social distancing, wearing a mask and opening up businesses when infections are down, hospitalizations are down and testing is readily available. he\u2019s a killer. not a president. @marcorubio biden said \"he\u2019s been totally irresponsible in the way in which he has handled the social distancing and people wearing masks, basically encouraged them not to. and he\u2019s a fool on this.\u201d  your \"god donald \" cares only about himself \"little marco\". disgraceful that you support him  @eliaspercival i had that same thought. trump would have just walked over and used biden\u2019s. forget social distancing. @richardmccrotch @wptabp @enzoriverss why would more black people die? think about it. are they not masking and social distancing? are they living with comorbilities? obese? you realize the propaganda isn\u2019t working, right? 200,000 out of 331,000,000 is .06%. scamdemic, not pandemic! social distancing is today embraced as a way to keep us safe from covid-19. .. also keeps us safe from \u201cconflicting theories and thoughts.\u201d chairs have been removed from social gathering places...people have few places to talk with each other.    @jennifermarguli i really don\u2019t understand this sentiment that president trump is responsible for deaths from covid. are presidents clinton, reagan or bush responsible for aids deaths? persons died wether experimental social distancing or masks were deployed. the science is showing no difference. @lisaschuman8 @ddale8 that\u2019s a great idea, to cut their microphones.  trump would probably run over to use biden\u2019s or mikes.  we know what he thinks about social distancing.  it drives me crazy when he keeps adjusting mics for others that speak after him.  there\u2019s a pandemic!!!! buhari was doing social distancing from his own country after he won, let\u2019s be guided.  @madjack91609651 @carisa18399456 @th30drawz @albertsstuff bruh also trump literally tried to insult biden for wearing a mask, social distancing, and not rallying thousands of people in one place during a global pandemic i know it\u2019s social distancing and all but could the next moderator (a with a mask) use the proximity approach to encourage the behavior to stop? mask? social distancing? lead by example!????  @climatedepot wearing masks and social distancing should make us safe from all viruses - right? and if not - why?? this is why people are sick of mask & social distancing they lack empathy ...passive aggressive narcissistic behavior  i think it\u2019s weird how many gays in here twenty about their random hookups during a pandemic and don\u2019t get dragged the way normal people not engaging in social distancing do.  y\u2019all know that shit is just as irresponsible right? @patrici58696373 @laibajaved26 @dog77780352 @starlane208 @joebiden masks are not needed when there\u2019s social distancing. also imma level with you on this one, fauci said masks could hand unintended consequences but the way it would increase cases is if people could wear them improperly and think they\u2019re protected (he\u2019s sorts right cuz it\u2019s true)", "summary": "President Trump's blase behaviour about observing precautions against Covid-19 proves controversial The majority believe that President Trump is not showing leadership by flouting safety precautions."}

did they get to go to court? 2. the whitehouse has been creating fake info on cdc letterhead bc god wants to downplay covid 3. border crossing is a misdemeanor. he arrested asylum seekers. tell me about jesus again. cdc forecasts up to 218k covid-19 deaths in us by oct 10  @thompsoncanute bro it's simple. covid by itself is not that serious. cdc has facts that state this. 94% of the 1% that pass with covid, had pre existing conditions. it's highly unlikely that anyone will die from getting covid alone if they have no conditions contributing to that @aspiemum @dr2nisreenalwan there are statistics. the cdc published in july it\u2019s one in three. @twihusband @b52malmet cdc publishes a range of projected excess death from covid. current range is in the screen grab below. from    @schwaid @costareports you will find on the cdc website how many died from suicide and had covid. patients who had sepsis and then got covid. many more. even people in car accidents. look at the state that put covid patients in nursing homes. they make up 40% of all the deaths. democrat run states. 2/1 @randybroresist @lindseygrahamsc bs. cdc reported 6% of the covid deaths on record died of covid. the rest died with it. it\u2019s an important distinction you should think about. @rosemarieperme1 @simonharristd the cdc never said any such thing. someone is lying to you. on 6% of death certificates, only covid is \"mentioned.\" that doesn't mean the other 94% didn't also die from covid. someone gets covid, then goes into respiratory arrest and dies. that death is in the 94%. @phillyzen @toynbee1600 @steveguest what is the actual number of covid deaths from only covid? i feel like getting the truth is hard. since cdc admits to only 6% of reported deaths to be from covid alone does that change your argument? when comparing us to other countries, are we counting the same way as them? while rational people, for good goddamn reason question any vaccine coming from/thru 45's admin...  why we not concerned abt safety of those participating in the trials  fda, cdc, surgeon gen, even task force shown will bend to.45's will... how we know the trials even safe  @marcgoldstein_ @peterbakernyt @single2jackie according to the cdc it would take like 2 minutes but even still we should ring the bells where they died, don't let up on the governors and state health directors who failed all those they slaughtered at nursing homes and long term care facilities i really don\u2019t understand all the hype. this is from the cdc website. more people die from the flu even though there is a vaccine. there are significantly more flu deaths than hospitalizations for covid.  @hjemmefronten16 @waospi the cdc website says yearly influenza strains cause up to 810,000 hospitalizations and up to 61,000 deaths in the u.s., so i don't know where you got your \"3,448\" number. @alexberenson seasonal flu killed more children this year than covid.

do not say masks since that\u2019s already been proven as bs. @senbobcasey yet you want families to stay home and not work.... the economy is built in restaurants, bars, and shopping outlets. yet these oppressive restrictions hamper the recovery of the economy over an overblown illness that has a recovery rate of over 99%. @revegelance @mykejm2 @rachelnotley @jkenney it\u2019s being worked on but people have tunnel vision & won\u2019t give it a chance. i have seen what this is doing to kids, they need to get back to school. if your child is compromised or u are a teacher or school staff compromised stay home! u have to do what is best for u @monstress69 i didn\u2019t even know meat had eyes til today!!!! i need to stay home cuz i don\u2019t know who all mine been lookin at :-/ @alameda9175 @tndeptofhealth guess they caved to the pressure.  healthy people do not need to wear masks. agree that sick people should socially distance and/or wear masks.  better still- sick people should stay home. to go to work or stay home,hmmm?

do you enslave a certain few for necessary things such as food, water, protections, health? @xjasminrivera it's okay to stay home on days off and do nothing !! it's your day off, and you're entitled to spend it however /you/ want. and relaxing at home is a great way to spend it. u don't always have to do things, especially when you've been busy at work. u deserve it. <33 @whitehouse @realdonaldtrump they use id cards for everything, buy liquor, fly, food stamps, bank. but they are afraid to use it for voting. stop everything right now, and make it absentee if you want to stay home. isn't there anything that can be done. stop them. if our grandparents/parents/siblings /children can put on a uniform to save democracy, our nation - we can fucking stop going 2 work, buying, keep kids home, etc. stay home or protest in streets. don't stop til demands  met!  #generalstrike2020 #generalstrike  #nationalstrike  planning to host summer gatherings or cook-outs with people not in your household?

a lot of us as black folks would see that statement as insulting. black folks aren\u2019t going to all of a sudden vote for trump, but if these unforced errors pile up folks will stay home. @lucky13_ms @andreajordan66 not to be rude, but good for you in not becoming a bad statistic instead of a good one. if there are some older, financially stable folks that can afford to stay home it must be because they sewed their crops and are reaping their rewards. god blessed them. help #fightcovidnyc! get tested and do the right thing: + wash your hands + social distance + wear a face covering + stay home if you are sick prevent the spread by getting tested:   at the time i was tested. either way i\u2019ve been symptom free for a week and i can be out in the world. wear a mask, stay home, get tested, get tested again. hey... if you travel, think about the communities you are traveling too.  mask up, wash your hands, and stay home if you've had any risk of exposure.    can employers require employees to quarantine?

a modern-day holocaust, every bit as horrendous as hitler, maybe worse. china virus! @realdonaldtrump i wish the white house can keep clarifying that not all chinese people are dumb followers of ccp. but using \u201cchina virus\u201d without clarification would bring trouble and bias to us chinese of freedom! we are confronting the same challenge from ccp! @tobesostup1d @butthurtmy @palmerreport @realdonaldtrump there's nothing racist about \"china virus\". if the virus originated in mexico and he said \"mexican virus\" i bet nobody would complain b/c people realize mexico isn't a race. but a lot of americans think asians look the same so chinese people must be all one race. no. hydroxy chloroquine - a doctor in the west treated patients with the china virus & they got well. the media is hyper about the china virus. @ingrahamangle @charliekirk11   @phillipdenton  @greggutfeld i find it funny how niggas on his team say stop callin it the china virus and he still calls it that nigga does not care  @hanh_n_ng @eugenegu @realdonaldtrump also non-asian people won\u2019t be able to tell you from ppl of chinese descent. a lot of hate crimes happening in the us are targeting asian-looking ppl. so him calling it the china virus put you and me in physical danger of racism. i worry more for the asian kids when school opens @hanh_n_ng @eugenegu @realdonaldtrump well, where are you exactly from\uff1findia\uff1fjapan\uff1fthen is there any relevance between where you come from and the nonsense-\"china virus\"? \u771f\u662f\u65e0\u8bed @redeye_the_netr @gol_mia @rationalgenius guess that is why you live in china where the whole china virus came from! you must work for the ccp you cannot claim to care about chinese people and what\u2019s happening in hong kong while also continuing to call it \u201cchina virus\u201d or \u201cchinese virus\u201d or \u201ckung flu\u201d   it\u2019s clearly a charade and a political power play and it\u2019s gross. @prettyangelboi @melvillemedia @nbcsandiego youre assuming the crowds which follow trump have the intellect to be able to understand this; which they do not. to them, and trump knows it, the 'china virus' represents anyone they believe is 'from china', including chinese americans. i love that trump is encouraging ppl to wear masks, but can we stop with the \"china virus\"? i get that he's jabbing at the government of china, not the ppl. but many ppl take it the wrong way. on purpose or by mistake.  trump used \u201cchina virus\u201d in the past bec trump got tired of many young gay asian bottoms get fucked by white men with small penis and now gay white men got positive of covid. why no black men? they can\u2019t handle big blk penis #gayasians  #gaymen all physicians should be ordering this med to anyone symptomatic with china virus  lol at all the racists saying china virus is racist. china is a country not a race. the majority race in china, and the ruling ccp party are han. your country is not your race. i love how bent out of shape people get about the term \"china virus\". like can yall get this mad about our high taxes and the fact that theyre used in inappropriate ways? after months of judging those of us who wore them, watching people throw temper tantrums because it\u2019s hurts their \u201cfreedom\u201d, and telling his followers ways to basically kill them selves by injecting bleach... now you wanna wear one. and it\u2019s covid-19 not the fucking china virus ", "summary": "Debate continues about whether or not \"China virus\" should be a term used for Covid-19 The majority believe \"China virus\" is the wrong term to use because it deflects from US spread and encourages attacks on Asians."}

Proves how thick people are panic buying \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f & so stopping elderly people getting their essentials, ffs!!!  @CNN Seeing the panic buying and stocking, one would have thought we were facing cholera epidemic rather than corona(virus). These people are crazy. If you are one of the people panic buying or buying more than usual in your weekly shop then you\u2019re cunt and I hope the Coronavirus hit you hard! Bellends! #COVID\u30fc19 #panicshopping #selfish #COVID\u30fc19 People of the uk get a grip and STOP fucking panic buying. @Pinkribbonmark2 If some people who are panic buying showed the dignity that some cancer sufferers have, the world would be a better place.  This behaviour is well below the belt. \ud83e\udd2c @haasboy1959 OOOORRR...carry on as normal, stop all this madness, this hysteria and panic buying, carry on as before, but get the government to provide sanitisation packs free to vulnerable people. Simples.  @Planet_Lucy part of me is worried, and part isn't, got information easily available which settles mind a bit, if no info available I'd be worse. what worries me is people panic buying and meaning vulnerable people can't get what they need. am 'lucky' in that did a freezer filling shop so ok The people who are panic buying are either scalpers hoping to sell at high prices, people that believe everything they read on the internet or people being panicked by the panickers. Help restore faith in human beings pals? #stoppanicbuying  @SayNoToLabour10 @MJH19191 They should already be doing this, in sensible amounts .... this panic buying is getting out of control When I went shopping yesterday I saw a lot of empty shelfs for a small town in rural England.   Really!  This panic buying is getting rediclous. There's no need for it. It's not end of the world  Can we just live like normal instead of panicking.  #COVID\u30fc19  #panicshopping   In Lidl doing my usual weekly shop and it's mental. I think I'm the one of the few not buying toilet roll. Also a lot of people seem to be panic buying wine... Did y'all not wash your hands or wipe your arse before the Corona virus or something?? The panic buying is ridiculous and selfish. People really do not know to act in a state of emergency. @DrAdrianHeald I don\u2019t see why they need so many toilet rolls when they\u2019re not panic buying food \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2640\ufe0f People. Stop panic buying and hoarding shit, ffs! This is a difficult time, for sure, but it's not the end of the world.  (Besides, even if it was the end of the world, what you do wouldn't make much sense either.)  Fascinating to see what people panic buy. Our local Tesco ran out of anything Heinz and there's own brand tins left, but all the cheap loo roll has gone and there's plenty of 'luxury'  packs available  Y\u2019all really gotta stop panic buying before we start panic robbing  stop panic buying! it\u2019s fucking useless! It\u2019s the people who don\u2019t need to be worried are the ones panic buying!! Think of the elderly and people who are actually in self-isolation. Actually can\u2019t stand how stupid people are Wish people would stop panic buying!! These people are just as bad as the disease itself absolutely no need for it  only people benefitting from it are the Supermarkets and Suppliers making millions and millions from it There are three types of people in this world. Those who selfishly panic buy. Those who buy just what they need and proceed as normal. Those who do things like this... \u2764\ufe0f  Australia: starts panic buying toilet paper weeks ago America: starts panic buying toilet paper this week and claims they started the trend  @sainsburys Could you answer the question as to why your restrictions on items aren\u2019t rigid enough to stop panic buying? 5 x 9 rolls of toilet paper doesn\u2019t seem like the appropriate limit. Surely it should be 1 or 2? @Jessmegandmum I have always kept about 3 months of food in my pantry just because I keep it stocked and live alone. I don\u2019t panic buy but I do buy extra when something is on sale. I haven\u2019t been to a store since the panic started so I don\u2019t the local situation here yet. I\u2019ll know Tuesday  Stop asking people not to panic buy and start enforcing limits of 1 or 2 items per person. Honestly.  Please stop panic buying. We\u2019re not running out of food, people are just hoarding when they don\u2019t need it. Save some for the elderly and fixed income people who can\u2019t afford to stock up like you selfishly are.  Even better, become more healthy. W'oops that requires some pre-thought, No panic buying, no stocking up for the next nuclear disaster, which hasn't been predicted yet! But you never know do u!!??? asian parents stock up on everything anyway, there\u2019s no need for us to be panic buying", "summary": "There are reports of panic-buying in the supermarkets as another Coronavirus wave looms.

it says before the \"china virus\" @ivankatrump list of accomplishments \u201c before the china virus...\u201d   f off! mismanagement  of  covid is on the administration, especially your robotic pinocchio husband and waxen bloated father. 4000 deaths a day, 10 months into the beginning of the lockdown. @ivankatrump anything after \u201cchina virus\u201d is invalid. list accomplishments after covid-19 hit. @ivankatrump but why \u201cchina virus?\u201d  it just starts off on a wrong tone... @ivankatrump it literally opens with \u201cthe china virus.\u201d   is it noon on the 20th yet?  so over your family. @ivankatrump i was actually going to read this article but the first line refers to the china virus.  i realized it was more trump propaganda and stopped reading. surprise. @ivankatrump is sharing an #accomplishment page that starts \"before the china virus invaded our shores\"  an official government page.  show of hands. who is surprised?  *crickets*  @ivankatrump literally fuck you! your entire family are fascist fucking nazis. the statement opens with...china virus for fucks sake. you are an incompetent failure just like daddy. bye #barbienazi @ivankatrump \"china virus\"? seriously? might i invite you and your screwed up, racist family to try to #bebest. @ivankatrump the fact that the statement starts by talking about the \"china virus\" speaks to the whole administration. racist, tone deaf, and completely out of touch with our country. boy bye. @ivankatrump \u201cbefore the china virus invaded our shores...\u201d  the administration\u2019s job didn\u2019t stop once covid arrived.  enjoy being synonymous with the biggest failure & disgrace in american history.  #evabraun2.0 @ivankatrump start of the \"achievements\" with the \"china virus\".  it's covid why does trump and his administration continue this?  the only reason is racism.  easier to blame someone different than admit his own incompetence. @ivankatrump \"china virus\" are you kidding me???? your father, you, the whole administration are an embarrassment!!  i cannot believe you posted accomplishments. your father is a joke that was never funny. bye bye @victoriaecrosby @ivankatrump no, ...thats truth.   it is the china virus, thats a fact @lisams2 @demsmental @kriseman not when somebody calls it a china virus after all this time @johnpavlovitz @ivankatrump it's really unbelievable that anyone calls covid-19 \"china virus\"....good riddance to you, ivanka, and the rest of your shithole family. not sharing it -- but ivanka's link -- it literally starts by saying \"china virus\".. need another country to blame for being absolute losers? ok. @ivankatrump still using china virus?  so glad you and your racist trash family are leaving.  your accomplishments have killed hundreds of thousands and ruined relationships across the globe along with trashing the planet.  you suck! @joebiden i am so sick seeing my family and friends family suffer from this planned china virus.  what the hell are you going to do about china.  it seems the dems or protecting china.  what is going on. @ivankatrump \u201cbefore the china virus\u201d  you fucking people i swear @ivankatrump the \"china virus\"? did you really promote a web page that calls the coronavirus the \"china\" virus? you are as awful as your mental father. shame on you. #ivankaforprison @ivankatrump one i saw \u201cchina virus\u201d i knew the rest of this is bs! grow up! and get out! @ivankatrump i stopped reading the moment it said \"china virus\" which means i didn't get very far at all. clearly, it's not worth reading when it starts with racism as an accomplishment. i just posted \"china virus kills hk in 2020: hong kong airport passenger traffic drops by 87.7% in 2020\" on reddit   @ivankatrump get this racist trash off a government website. literally starting it with \u201cchina virus\u201d. this administration is trash and so are you for sharing this. @ivankatrump just stop with the \u201cchina virus\u201d reference!  and fir the rest of it... lies!\ud83e\udd2e\ud83e\udd2c @ivankatrump i stopped reading after china virus. you people are disgusting. i can't wait until we never see you again until your perp walk. a @floridaatlantic health professor joined his zoom class wearing a trump 2020 hat and referred to covid-19 as the china virus..... yes, a health professor. great scoop by @upressonline.  @ivankatrump your statement begins with racism ...\u201dbefore the china virus.\u201d @ivankatrump news flash- it\u2019s called covid-19 ( sans the new variants), not the \u201cchina virus\u201d.....  get off your high horse and call it by it\u2019s cdc given proper name.   ignorant. @kopsmiss @ivankatrump since you @ivankatrump  are presidenting, it is not china virus. it is covid-19 (sars-cov-2). but, most people know it as trump virus @ivankatrump what fucking douches y\u2019all are. even in official government website you call it the china virus.. and seriously who designed the page? a elementary school student you fucking fascist. @ivankatrump note that your \"accomplishments\" start out \"before the china virus.\" trump was president long after covid hit. his overall record is dismal. nearly 400,000 dead. record numbers unemployed. america divided. #trumpisacompletefailure lost me at \u201cchina virus.\u201d  (1) 400,000 people will be dead from covid-19, (2) tried to assassinate vice president. that pretty much sums it up.  @ivankatrump this begins \u201cbefore the china virus ...\u201d the actual name is covid-19. and, i doubt you\u2019ve noticed, but it\u2019s an american virus, an european virus, a virus for our entire planet. after reading that, i didn\u2019t need to read any so-called accomplishments further; he failed at that one was the china virus a clever ploy to simply destabilise the european economy, bankrupt european countries & turn them against america - i think so.  china has no virus, no masks, no vaccines wtf..  canada just gave china $39 billion.  where does all the ppe come from ? sorry, i couldn\u2019t get past the first header & the fact that this racist fucking administration put the words \u201cchina virus\u201d on the official  website.   fuck these people. if you like anyone named trump, you\u2019re a racist and deserve all the shame ppl give you.  i followed this link and the first words i saw were \u201cchina virus\u201d  @brianspanner1 @jintsymaginty @lockdownno @leref5 no, but it seems that there are those using it to advance their own causes, from the enviro lobby, the who, wef, nhs/public health activists down to local councils. common sense replaced by dumb data, politicians weakened by frenzied msm/social media. and a nasty china virus. @kopsmiss @ivankatrump china and dumbcrats gave us and the world the china virus. the rest, you need to take an economics class because you're stupid. i'm wondering if the biden administration will keep using the name \"china virus.\"   fau professor calls covid-19 \u201cchina virus,\u201d wears trump hat during class, angering students \u2013 university press  the number of times this says \u201cchina virus\u201d instead of \u201ccovid-19\u201d  or \u201ccorona virus\u201d or literally anything else is disgusting  calling covid-19 the \"china virus\" on a govt page is one of the  lowest points of america's history. despicable. @cnet another dumb ass idea trying to bank on china virus. the ring alerts you when motion detected, why would anyone need this?", "summary": "As President Trump leaves the White House, Ivanka Trump lists his achievements in office.

@donaldjtrumpjr twitter should ban the cdc for spreading conspiracy theories @thehill conspiracy theory?  don't guess you got the memo from the cdc.....9,700 total deaths in the u.s no conspiracy there. that number will probably drop, or should anyway. @bradheath if president persists in making unsubstantiated claims, he will be censured. he lacks the skills to take positions on quant research.  cdc needs to explain their categorizations & what impact it has on official death rates. asap. having a pec does not mean you did not have cv19. @washingtonpost it\u2019s not a conspiracy theory, it\u2019s information put forth from the cdc. @washingtonpost so the cdc is spreading conspiracy theories according to the washington post? \ud83e\udd14 \"cdc data\" is conspiracy theory ??? i'm done with these pathetic journalists. what's this  @thehill explain how the cdc data is a conspiracy theory!!!!! @thehill how is cdc data a conspiracy theory?  94% had 2.6 serious other conditions.  deaths are less this year.  explain that.  and stop calling names it is not an argument. @washingtonpost it\u2019s not a \u201cconspiracy theory\u201d if it\u2019s the cdc\u2019s own revised numbers. can you guy\u2019s at the washington post do any research? @washingtonpost it's the cdc that's putting the data out. you people are clowns. cdc deluged with \u2018insane\u2019 number of calls about \u2018six percent\u2019 coronavirus conspiracy theory  @thehill so the cdc data is now conspiracy theory ?   how dumb do you a**holes think people are ? @francineb12 @tc05281 @lyrical_bard @benjamminham @hillaryclinton @realdonaldtrump hmmm so the cdc puts out false information? it\u2019s so frustrating to see the cdc and other government and health organizations now saying things regarding covid i\u2019ve been saying since march. my posts/tweets about immunity, transmission, mortality rates, etc... all removed for false information.    #putthatinyourpipe conspiracy theory? it was printed by the cdc.  the hill is a puppet with a leftist hand up their ass.   tip of my hat to the anti-masker who got so angry on being corrected about their claim the who said masks were ineffective, & then being corrected on claiming the cdc said similar, that they just deleted their comments entirely. the cdc is the one who said the death toll numbers are wrong, trump was just questioning their finding.  fake news as usual.  @washingtonpost so, the anything the cdc releases that the media hates is now a conspiracy theory?  trump is going to need to destroy these media company traitors in his second term or americans are going to do it themselves. i saw it myself on the  website. are you accusing the cdc of starting a conspiracy theory?  @washingtonpost ummm, so now the cdc is an anon?  a conspiracy theory, really?  could you be any more irresponsible? @ajozefiak @cnbc cdc isn't wrong, ppl cherry-picking a single data point and (deliberately?) misinterpreting it is what's wrong. @thehill do you really think the people are so dumb that they won't look up the cdc website for themselves? as you guys are finding out, it is not a good thing to lie to the people  there\u2019s a theory being promoted by qanon. they misread data from the cdc to claim that only 6,000 have died from it. that\u2019s not true. the data (a scientificy thing) shows that 202death rates vs. historical rates are inordinately high. please take the covid precautions seriously.  @washingtonpost cdc data is not a conspiracy. but wapo \u201copinions\u201d are. @ynwa_richie @brennangaye @drzerocraic @rubberbandits but it\u2019s not an alternative view. it\u2019s a complete misrepresentation of cdc data put forward by a qanon conspiracy theorist to deliberately mislead the public with fake information. bro. \ud83e\udd19  @washingtonpost the cdc is well known to have spread some of the worlds most famous conspiracy theories. the people misinterpreting the cdc data and calling them liars are the same people who had to take biology 3 times in high school", "summary": "CDC causes controversy by revising data to show direct and indirect Covid-19 deaths The majority believe that the CDC revised data validates opinion that has previously been dubbed conspiracy theories."}
