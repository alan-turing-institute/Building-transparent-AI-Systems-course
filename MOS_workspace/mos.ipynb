        "1. <b>Word-overlap</b>: ROUGE (Lin et al.,2004, https://aclanthology.org/W04-1013.pdf) is the most used metric in summarisation tasks. It calculates the n-gram overlap between system and candidate summaries. In our experiment, we use the harmonic mean F_1 of ROUGE-1 (unigrams), ROUGE-2 (bigrams) and ROUGE-L (longest sequence). By design, the metric is unable to detect semantic similarity (<i>happy kid</i> and <i>joyful child</i> are identified as disjoint and are penalised).\n",

        "2. <b>Semantic Similarity</b>: BERTScore (Zhang et al, 2020, https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.09675.pdf) is used in machine generation tasks to detect the level of semantic similarity between a pair of texts. It relies on BERT contextual embeddings and greedy token matching and it has been shown to correlate well with human judgement. It achieved competitive results in machine translation and image captioning due to its robustness in paraphrasing."
